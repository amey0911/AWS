In AWS EC2, **Public IP addresses**, **Private IP addresses**, and **Elastic IP addresses** are used for different purposes when it comes to networking and communicating with your EC2 instances. Here's a breakdown of each and how they are used:

---

### 1. **Private IP Address**

A **Private IP address** is an IP address that is used for internal communication within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and is not routable from the internet.

- **Scope**: Private IP addresses are used to enable communication between EC2 instances within the same VPC. They are assigned automatically when you launch an instance, and you can also assign additional private IPs to instances.
  
- **Range**: These IP addresses fall within the private IP address ranges defined by RFC 1918:
  - `10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255`
  - `172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255`
  - `192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255`

- **Use Cases**:
  - Internal communication between EC2 instances within the same VPC.
  - Instances in private subnets (without direct internet access) can use private IPs to communicate with other resources in the VPC.
  - Instances can communicate with other resources (e.g., databases, services) using private IPs.

- **Example**: 
  - An EC2 instance launched in a private subnet will have a private IP such as `172.31.16.54`. This can only be accessed from other instances in the same VPC or through a VPN/Direct Connect.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Non-routable on the Internet**: Private IPs cannot be accessed directly from the internet.
  - **Persistence**: Private IPs remain associated with the instance until it is terminated (unless you assign additional static private IPs).

### 2. **Public IP Address**

A **Public IP address** is an IP address that is routable over the internet, allowing external devices to communicate with your EC2 instance directly.

- **Scope**: Public IPs are assigned to EC2 instances in a **public subnet** (a subnet with a route to the internet via an Internet Gateway). These public IPs are dynamic and change when the instance is stopped and restarted.

- **Type**: By default, when you launch an EC2 instance in a public subnet, AWS assigns it a **dynamic public IP address** from the pool of available IPs.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Direct internet-facing access (e.g., hosting a website, public-facing APIs).
  - When you need to access the instance from the internet (e.g., SSH or RDP into the instance).

- **Example**:
  - An instance might have a private IP of `172.31.16.54` and a public IP of `54.123.45.67`. You can access the instance from the internet using the public IP.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Dynamic**: Public IPs are **dynamically assigned** by AWS and are released when the instance is stopped or terminated.
  - **Non-persistent**: The IP address is not persistent across reboots unless specifically associated with an Elastic IP.

### 3. **Elastic IP Address (EIP)**

An **Elastic IP address (EIP)** is a static, public IPv4 address that you can associate with your AWS EC2 instances.

- **Scope**: Unlike the dynamic public IP, an Elastic IP is **persistent**, meaning it remains the same even if you stop and start the instance. It can be reassigned to different instances or resources in your account, which provides a high level of flexibility.

- **Use Cases**:
  - If you need a static IP for your application (e.g., for DNS purposes or for external applications to always connect to the same IP).
  - To maintain the same public IP address even if the underlying EC2 instance is stopped and started.
  - For high availability: You can reassign the EIP to another instance in case your current instance fails.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Static and Persistent**: Unlike public IPs, an EIP is static and does not change unless you release it or move it to a different instance.
  - **Additional Cost**: AWS provides one free EIP per account (as long as it is associated with a running instance). If an EIP is not associated with a running instance, AWS may charge you for it.
  - **Can be Re-associated**: You can disassociate an EIP from one EC2 instance and associate it with another instance.

- **Example**:
  - Suppose you have an EC2 instance running a web server that has a private IP of `172.31.16.54` and a dynamic public IP of `54.123.45.67`. You associate an EIP (`18.192.13.23`) to this instance so that the web server always has the same IP address even if the instance is stopped and started.

#### **How to Allocate and Associate an Elastic IP**:

1. **Allocate an Elastic IP**:
   - Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** > **Elastic IPs** > **Allocate new address**.

2. **Associate the Elastic IP**:
   - Once the EIP is allocated, you can associate it with a running EC2 instance by selecting the EIP and clicking **Associate**. Youâ€™ll then select the EC2 instance and its network interface.

### **Key Differences Between Public IP, Private IP, and Elastic IP**

| Feature                  | **Private IP**                                    | **Public IP**                                    | **Elastic IP**                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Routable**              | No, only within the VPC                           | Yes, routable over the internet                  | Yes, routable over the internet                |
| **Scope**                 | Internal communication within the VPC             | Communication with the public internet           | Communication with the public internet         |
| **Persistence**           | Persistent until the instance is terminated       | Temporary, changes if instance is stopped/restarted | Persistent, until manually disassociated or released |
| **Assigned By**           | Automatically assigned by AWS                     | Automatically assigned by AWS (dynamic)          | Manually allocated by the user                 |
| **Use Case**              | Internal instance communication                   | Public-facing services (e.g., websites, APIs)    | Static IP for highly available or failover applications |
| **Cost**                  | Free                                              | Free (as long as the instance is running)        | Free for one EIP, additional charges for idle EIPs |

### **Example Scenario**

Let's imagine you have an EC2 instance running a web server in a public subnet:

- **Private IP**: `10.0.1.5` - This is used for communication with other EC2 instances or resources within your VPC.
- **Public IP**: `52.32.14.58` - This is the dynamically assigned IP you can use to connect to the instance from the internet.
- **Elastic IP**: `18.192.45.23` - You allocate an Elastic IP to ensure the web server always has the same IP address, even if the EC2 instance is stopped and started.

---

### **Best Practices**

- **Use Private IPs for Internal Communication**: When instances need to communicate within the VPC, always use private IPs to ensure that traffic stays internal and is more secure.
- **Use Public IPs for Direct Internet Access**: Assign public IPs to instances that need direct access from the internet, such as web servers.
- **Use Elastic IPs for Static Access**: When you require a static IP for critical services (e.g., DNS records pointing to a fixed IP), use Elastic IPs. Ensure the Elastic IP is associated with a running instance to avoid additional charges.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Private IPs** are ideal for internal communications within a VPC.
- **Public IPs** are temporary and are used for direct communication between an EC2 instance and the internet.
- **Elastic IPs** are static and persistent public IPs that can be re-assigned to EC2 instances, offering greater flexibility and reliability for services that need to be accessible by a fixed IP.
