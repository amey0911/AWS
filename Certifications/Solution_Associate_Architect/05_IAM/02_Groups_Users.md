### **Understanding AWS IAM Groups and Users**

In AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), **users** and **groups** are key concepts that help manage permissions and access control. Here’s an overview:

#### **1. IAM Users:**
- **What is a user?**
  - An **IAM user** is an identity that represents a person or application that interacts with AWS resources.
  - Each user has a **unique name** and can have **credentials** (such as passwords for console login or access keys for programmatic access) to authenticate themselves.
  - IAM users are usually assigned permissions (via **policies**) that define what actions they can or cannot perform on AWS resources.

- **Types of Credentials for Users:**
  - **Console Access**: A password is created for the user, allowing them to log in to the AWS Management Console.
  - **Programmatic Access**: An **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** are created for API, AWS CLI, or SDK access.

#### **2. IAM Groups:**
- **What is a group?**
  - An **IAM group** is a collection of IAM users. Groups allow you to manage permissions for multiple users at once, rather than assigning permissions individually to each user.
  - You can attach **policies** to a group, and all users in that group inherit the permissions associated with the group.
  - For example, you can create a group called `Developers`, and then attach policies that grant full access to EC2. Any user added to this group will automatically have the permissions granted to the group.

- **Use Case of Groups:**
  - **DevOps Group**: You might create a `DevOps` group that has full access to EC2, S3, etc. Any user added to this group will inherit those permissions.

### **Providing EC2 Access Using IAM Users and Groups (Step-by-Step Guide)**

Let’s go through the steps for setting up **IAM Users and Groups** for EC2 access, both via **AWS Console** and **programmatically** (CLI/API), using the AWS Management Console.

#### **Step 1: Create IAM Policies for EC2 Access**

1. **Create a Policy for Full EC2 Access (Programmatic and Console)**:
   - This policy grants full access to EC2 resources via both the AWS Management Console and programmatically using AWS CLI, SDK, or API.
   - **Policy Example** (`EC2FullAccess`):
     ```json
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Action": "ec2:*",
                 "Resource": "*"
             }
         ]
     }
     ```

2. **Create a Policy for Read-Only EC2 Access (Console Only)**:
   - This policy grants **read-only** access to EC2 resources through the **AWS Console**, without allowing programmatic access.
   - **Policy Example** (`EC2ReadOnlyConsole`):
     ```json
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Action": "ec2:Describe*",
                 "Resource": "*"
             }
         ]
     }
     ```

3. **Create a Policy for EC2 Access via Console Only (No Programmatic Access)**:
   - This policy allows full access to EC2 resources but only through the **AWS Console**.
   - **Policy Example** (`EC2ConsoleOnly`):
     ```json
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Action": "ec2:*",
                 "Resource": "*",
                 "Condition": {
                     "StringEquals": {
                         "aws:RequestTag/ConsoleOnly": "true"
                     }
                 }
             },
             {
                 "Effect": "Deny",
                 "Action": "ec2:*",
                 "Resource": "*",
                 "Condition": {
                     "StringEquals": {
                         "aws:RequestTag/ConsoleOnly": "false"
                     }
                 }
             }
         ]
     }
     ```

#### **Step 2: Create IAM Groups for EC2 Access**

1. **Create the Developer Group** (Full EC2 Access - Console and Programmatic):
   - In the **IAM Console**, go to **Groups** → **Create New Group**.
   - Name the group `Developers`.
   - Attach the **`EC2FullAccess`** policy to the group.
   - This group will have full access to EC2 both via the Console and programmatically using the CLI/SDK.

2. **Create the Test User Group** (Read-Only EC2 Access - Console Only):
   - In the **IAM Console**, go to **Groups** → **Create New Group**.
   - Name the group `TestUsers`.
   - Attach the **`EC2ReadOnlyConsole`** policy to the group.
   - This group will have read-only access to EC2 via the Console, and **no programmatic access**.

3. **Create the Implementor Group** (Full EC2 Access - Console Only):
   - In the **IAM Console**, go to **Groups** → **Create New Group**.
   - Name the group `Implementors`.
   - Attach the **`EC2ConsoleOnly`** policy to the group.
   - This group will have full access to EC2 via the Console, but **no access programmatically**.

#### **Step 3: Create IAM Users and Add Them to Groups**

1. **Create Developer User** (Full Access to EC2 via Console and Programmatic):
   - Go to **IAM > Users > Add User**.
   - Name the user `developer1`.
   - Provide **Console Access** and **Programmatic Access** (generate access key for CLI/SDK).
   - Add `developer1` to the `Developers` group.
   - This user will have full access to EC2 via both the AWS Console and programmatically using CLI/SDK.

2. **Create Test User** (Read-Only Access to EC2 via Console):
   - Go to **IAM > Users > Add User**.
   - Name the user `testuser1`.
   - Provide **Console Access** (no programmatic access).
   - Add `testuser1` to the `TestUsers` group.
   - This user will have read-only access to EC2 via the AWS Console.

3. **Create Implementor User** (Full Access to EC2 via Console, No Programmatic Access):
   - Go to **IAM > Users > Add User**.
   - Name the user `implementor1`.
   - Provide **Console Access** (no programmatic access).
   - Add `implementor1` to the `Implementors` group.
   - This user will have full EC2 access via the Console but no access via CLI/SDK.

#### **Step 4: Verify User Permissions**

After creating the users and assigning them to appropriate groups, you should verify that they have the correct access:

1. **Test Developer Access**:
   - Log in as `developer1` to the AWS Console and confirm that the user has **full access** to EC2.
   - Run EC2 CLI commands (e.g., `aws ec2 describe-instances`) to ensure programmatic access is working.

2. **Test Test User Access**:
   - Log in as `testuser1` to the AWS Console and confirm that the user has **read-only access** to EC2 (can view instances but cannot modify them).
   - Confirm that programmatic access is not available by testing with CLI commands (e.g., `aws ec2 describe-instances` will fail).

3. **Test Implementor Access**:
   - Log in as `implementor1` to the AWS Console and confirm that the user has **full EC2 access** via the Console.
   - Confirm that programmatic access is not available by attempting to use the AWS CLI or SDK.

### **Summary**

Here’s a recap of the **EC2 Access Setup**:

| **Group**       | **Console Access**        | **Programmatic Access**    | **Permissions**            |
|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Developers**   | Full EC2 Console Access   | Full Programmatic Access   | Full EC2 Access (Create, Modify, Delete, Describe) |
| **TestUsers**    | Read-Only EC2 Console Access | No Programmatic Access     | View EC2 Instances (No modifications) |
| **Implementors** | Full EC2 Console Access   | No Programmatic Access     | Full EC2 Access (Only via Console, no CLI/SDK) |

By following the above steps, you can manage access to EC2 resources based on roles, ensuring that users only have the permissions they need to perform their tasks.
